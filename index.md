# Portfolio



## Week: 1
The first week of this semester was very similar to the first week of last semester. However, this time I did not have to choose which project I was doing as I had signed up to continue working on the Game Development project. This time I knew I was working on the big game instead of just a smaller side project. I met up with my team for this semester, and it was just me and Mitchell, who I had been working with partially last semester. We set up our workspaces and got a debrief of what this game was all about. This game really interested me, and I was excited to begin working on it.

### Reflection:
Not much to reflect on this week. I'm happy to see im working with people I already know, and work well with. The debrief of the game gave me a good idea on what kind of game we were attempting to develop, and it is the kind of game I enjoy playing so this should be a very interesting learning experience for me.

## Week: 2
The second week presented our first set of problems. We didn't have any up to date versions of the game from last semester. We had the files that were stored on GitLab, but they did not include all of the assets due to them being too large to go onto GitLab. Our project leader, Adon, said that the previous students to work on this project had stored their assets onto a server. This presented another problem. We had no access to the servers as the keys had expired to use the servers, so we had to wait until the dev-ops team could get them back into our posession.

### Reflection:
Another non productive week unfortunately. I used this time to read up on some of the documentation that the previous students had worked on, which meant I got a good understanding on how the game actually works. I found it interesting that they have been using a server to store all of their assets on. It was quite a smart move to avoid dealing with GitHub's problems with large files.

## Week: 3
This week finally allowed us to start work on the project. We managed to get a copy of the up to date version of the game. This week was primarily about learning how the game worked. Much of this stuff was new to us both, and we had to learn a lot before diving into this, as we both had not worked on a multiplayer game before. I was also assigned my first task. I was to make a Heads Up Display (HUD) for the user's that displayed their health, their posession timer and a third undecided bar (perhaps a stamina bar). We had some assets from the design school, so I just had to program them to be linked into our player's health and posession values, then animate the images. I got this working well locally, however I tested it on a server side and the local player's HUD controlled all clients who connected to the server's HUD. This was something I needed to fix next week.

### Reflection:
This week was about learning how this game was properly structured, now that we had access to the game. There was a lot to learn, but luckily Adon had been very helpful in directing us where to find stuff that we needed early on. I have already started to work in a different mindset than I had been previously. I have been learning to think about how what I am making will work in a multiplayer environment, rather than just a singleplayer environment.

## Week: 4
My first task of the week was to finish this HUD, as Adon really wanted it out of the way. I figured out that to fix this problem I was having, was that I needed to have each component of the HUD to be displayed on each player's individual cameras. This took a wee bit of thinking, but in the end it was a rather easy solution, and I got it up and running pretty quickly. I believe at this point, Adon decided that I was going to be doing the design side of the game primarily, as the next task I was assigned was to make a pause menu for the game. Luckily, this ended up being an almost identical process to the HUD, so I managed to get that done very quickly. This gave me some time to give these User Interfaces (UI) a good code cleanup. I gave them all dynamic methods, so that it was super easy in the future to add to these, and have them work in the network. 

### Reflection:
This week I figured out the best way to have each individual user have their own UI elements, without them conflicting with other player's UI. This was very interesting to learn, and has given me plenty of ideas on how to implement other client side solutions in the future.

## Week: 5
This week, I finished the pause menu by having all of the pause buttons do something. Currently, we have no settings menu, so the settings menu just unpauses the game, but that's an easy fix. I also added in the SKIN font. Just to top things off, I added a nice slide in animation for the pause menu to make it look a little more polished. Adon was not here to give any more things to do, and I had already finished everything he wanted done, plus a few extra bug fixes, so I decided to get started on an inventory system. I created a temporary circle menu, similar to that from other survival games, and got all the base code setup for that.

### Reflection:
I finished all the work assigned to me while our project manager was not around, so I began working on the list on bugs that I knew were present in the game. I knew that fixing these bugs will just open up more bugs in the future (typical programmer problems), so I decided to be a little more productive and try and create the initial inventory system. The last group of students had tried, but never completed it, so I decided to start from scratch.

## Week: 6
I finished up the circle menu, by having all 4 slots working, and having it work properly on the network. This process was slightly different to the HUD stuff, as it also had to stop the local player's mouse movement while in it. Adon also told me to look into a demo designed by Unity called Book of the Dead. It was a demo showcase to show off the power of Unity, and contained a very beautiful scene. Adon wanted me to see if I was able to use some of their free assets to recreate the graphics shown off in this demo. I was told that the previous students working on this project couldn't get it to work, however I was optimistic. I learnt that this demo was running in a different rendering pipeline than the one our game was running in. It was running in the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), which was very different to what we were using, and handled everything very differently to how our game currently handles stuff. Adon really wanted to get these assets working, and so did I, so I did my research on HDRP and learnt that I would need to create a whole new scene, and essentially rebuild the game from the ground up in HDRP. I created a new HRDP project, and put it aside until next week.

### Reflection:
I learnt a lot about making dynamic inventory systems. It was quite an interesting process to see how other game studios develop their inventories, and what they consider when making them (such as if the player can move etc). I also learnt A LOT about render pipelines in Unity. I didn't realise how indepth the different pipelines were, and it was interesting to see how the HDRP would work in this game. I was blown away by the graphics in the Book of the Dead showcase, and I want to try and get this working in our own scene.

## Week: 7
This week, we met with a design student who had been creating us a new Wolf asset for his design project. He sent us the files, and I decided to try and get this wolf working in both our original scene and the Book of the Dead scene. He came in the same day so I was able to learn which wolf he wanted us to use (as he gave us many different versions of it). We played around and got it working in our original game scene, and our original wolf AI eventually worked with a few tweaks. After we got all this working, I decided to try and get it to work in the Book of the Dead scene. I played around with the wolf's shaders, and eventually figured out how to convert it to an HDRP asset. This was crucial to figuring out how to implement more Book of the Dead stuff. The wolf now worked in the Book of the Dead scene, so I knew that next week I had something to work on. However, before that, I was instructed to create an intro scene for the game which included the Polytech's game studio logo (Forth Street Studio), as well as the SKIN logo, and a main menu. I setup a basic intro scene, which included some music that a music student created for us. I played around with timings and animations to get a basic intro scene that was in time with the music we were provided.

### Reflection:
This week I learnt a bit about how 3D models are created and implemented into games. I touched on animations as the wolf has a couple of animations linked to it. I also learnt about how Unity handles HDRP assets, and figured out a way to allow us to convert our current assets into HDRP assets using HDRP shaders. Making the intro scene was interesting as I got to learn about the 2D animations in Unity. I also got to reuse something I had created last Semester, which was a simple co-routine clock.

## Week: 8
This week I began adding some particles to the intro scene. I suggested that we could have some smoke or something in the intro scene to make the black background a little more interesting (similar to Skyrim), and Adon suggested I try and get a dusty/pollen looking particle effect to fit the theme of the game. I found Unity's own particle pack, which I took apart and grabbed their dust particle effects. I applied this to the intro and tweaked it a little and it actually looked pretty good. So I finished off this intro for now, and fixed up a new graphical features of the HUD, including an issue where the HUD started hiding behind certain objects in the scene. This just required me to apply a new shader to their UI. Once I got all of this working, I was able to get back to playing around with Book of the Dead. I played around with bringing assets between the two projects, but I was only able to bring assets from our game project into the Book of the Dead scene, and not vice versa. This meant that I would have to follow through with rebuilding the game in a new HDRP scene. Mitchell had recently built a temporary test terrain, which I was able to convert to HDRP and then bring into this new scene. From here I was able to get all of our old important assets to work in HDRP, and start creating a basic scene out of it.

### Reflection:
This week I learnt about particles in Unity and how Unity handles them. It was very helpful to have a demo scene that Unity created which showcased different kinds of particle effects they have made. I was able to look into how they made their effects look so interesting, and learn how to make our dust effect. I am also slowly learning how to get our game to run HDRP, rather than the pipeline we are currently on.

## Week 9:
An HDRP scene that contains Book of the Dead assets has been created! It was actually possible, after all of our struggles, I eventually got it working. I had only brought in a single tree and a single grass asset and built a very basic scene out of it. It didn't look anywhere near as good as Book of the Dead, so I decided to break down the Book of the Dead scene, asset by asset. I learnt that it uses some pretty intense post processing, which I was able to replicate similarily in our game scene which improved our visuals by a lot. I also learnt that the most important feature that Book of the Dead uses to make their scene to pretty, is a thing called Occlussion Probes. This is something that was custom built by Unity just for this showcase demo, and was far too advanced for 3rd year students, so unfortunatley, no matter how hard I tried, I wouldn't be able to make our scene as pretty as Book of the Dead. But that wasm't a bad thing, as I had now unlocked the secret to getting the 4K textured assets from Book of the Dead. Next step is to implement some more things into our game.

### Reflection:
It was good to get the Book of the Dead assets working in our game, and it has improved our game's visuals by a lot. After learning that we could not get the same Occlususion probes that Unity uses, I was a little sad that we would not be able to completely replicate the amazing graphics that Book of the Dead provided, but it was great to see the HDRP working in our game.

## Week 10:
This was the last week of the term, so I wanted to just clean this game up and get it looking all pretty before the holidays so that I wouldn't need to worry about this stuff as much next term. I finished implementing some post processing, similar to what Book of the Dead uses, and honestly the game looks quite nice. It still has a lot to go before it is in a beautiful state, but I managed to get some nice lighting, shadows and details going in our scene. I brought some more assets from Book of the Dead into our new HDRP game project, and got them all working in here. I also needed to create a new sky for our scene. This is due to using HDRP, our old sky no longer worked, so I had to figure out how to make a HDRP sky. There were 3 options for this, however I just stuck with the basic HDRI sky for now as there is no need for anything more advanced.

### Reflection:
This week I learnt that a skybox is rendered completely differently in HDRP than it is is the default pipeline. HDRP provides different types of skyboxes for different situations, and they are all very interesting. This made making a basic sky rather simple.

## Holidays:
Over the holidays, I had a Book of the Dead scene at home which I played around with to try and see if I could get any sort of Occlusion Probes to work in our game. I was unsuccessful unfortunately. However, I did learn a lot about how the Book of the Dead makes their scene so pretty. Their terrain by itself is very ugly, but it was a matter of how they places all of their assets that made the showcase look so amazing. This is something to keep in mind when building up our new scenes in HDRP.

## Week 11:
First week back of the term, and I have been working on making a small scene. I have added in some large rocks and different types of trees and grass. The scene is not very well layed out, but it was to more to stress test the assets to see how well they run in our game. Performance was a big issue, but I figured out that the game was rendering our grass to the CPU rather than the GPU, so I was able to fix the performance and get the game running at a solid 100fps with dense forestry. 

### Reflection:
I learnt a lot this week about game optimisation. I learnt that Unity quite often handles grass in the CPU by default, which can cause some serious performance issues, and it made me look into further performance tweaks.

## Week 12:
Adon has requested a day/night cycle, so this week was about brainstorming how we want our day/night cycle to work, and how we are going to implement it. We decided that we want a more realistic styled day/night cycle, and we want the sky colour to react to the time of the day so I set out to create a basic 24 hour in game time. This didn't take much to do, we just created the basic variables for hours, minutes, seconds etc and this meant that our game had a proper 24 hour cycle and 365 days in a year. This meant we could have events trigger at different times of days, inlcuding the sky gradient change at the right time. So, instead of using the HDRI sky I was using before, we changed our sky to a gradient sky, and setup a script that controlled the colour shifts of the gradients at the different times of day. We used some placeholder colours, and got it worked at a basic level. This looked okay, but we knew it would look really good once we sorted the colours out, so I spent the rest of the week getting images off google of different parts of the day, and trying to recreate those using a gradient colour pallet. This didn't take too long, however I did now have enough time to implement these properly this week.

### Reflection:
This week I learnt some good techniques on how to "fake" visuals in the game. Our sun is just a sphere game object that gives off light, and our sky just has some set colour values that it lerps (changes) between. However, when the game is running, the sky actually looks convincing as the day/night cycle goes on, even if the gradient colours are not yet set properly. 

## Week 13:
The first thing I did this week was implement the colour gradients into the sky. I got them all added in at the right times, and it actually made the game look very pretty, especially in the morning when the sun first rises. I was very happy with what we had produced, and felt like it was close to being a pretty as the Book of the Dead scene. One problem we had was that our sun and moon game objects kept disappearing as they got higher in the sky, and this was due to our render distance not being far enough. Originally, I had the idea of adding a second camera to the player, which only rendered the sun and moon at a very high render distance, but decided to scrap that idea once I tried just increasing the game's render distance without any performance loss. This may need to change in the future, as our scene isn't very performance intensive anyway. The next stage in this development was to add some character animations to the players when the player is standing idle, and when they are possessing an animal. I managed to get some animations working pretty quickly, thanks to Nick who was working on a different part of the game development prject. He had just finished working with his animations, and was able to give me some quick pointers on how it all worked. I got some idle animations set up, and an animation that loops and looks all jittery when possessing, but Adon just wanted me to get a placeholder for the next people to work on this project to continue. We also learnt that we would be showcasing this game at a government game developer meetup at the DCC next week. So we knew we had to polish up the game before then, so it was back to just cleaning up any obvious bugs we had, such as things falling through the map, and camera clipping etc.

### Reflection:
This week was all about bug fixing. I fixed most of the bugs that were obvious from things I had been making which was helpful. I also boosted our performance a bit more, which allowed me to boost our render distance up to a large number so we could see the sun and moon, while also being able to see a lot of distant detail.

## Week 14:
Mitchell and I started this week off by merging our projects together again. This caused A LOT of issues, due to the HDRP changing so much of our scenes. This happened just 2 days before we had to go to the DCC town hall so it begand to get a bit stressful. We managed to get a lot of the stuff working again, but had to sacrifice a lot of the newer features to get a stable game for the meetup. Our performance on the game had completely gone out the door, but that did not matter for this showcase. Once the showcase was done, we worked on fixing these issues. Our performance issues were mainly down to there being too many cameras in the scene, that had been carried over from the merge and duplicated. That was an easy fix once we figured that out, along with a lot of the other missing features.

### Reflection:
This week was an exciting week. We got to go to the DCC to show off our game. This event did not end up providing much feedback, but it was still a fun experience. I spent several hours each day this week working on this game at Polytech, and we got a lot done. I ended up spending upwards of 20 hours this week working on the game, trying to wash out some old bugs that have been causing issues.

## Week 15:
Performance issues were the first important thing I worked on this week. I got my scene running at a solid 120fps again, and it even ran smoother than it did before we had our merge issues which was a bonus. This week, Adon and I decided that when possession, we should have some particles show up while possesssing. I took this a step further and decided to have a particle effect be in the shape of the animal I was posessing. This took a wee bit of learning on how to use the Unity particle system, but the results ended up looking really good! Currently it is a deer no matter what animal you possess, however this is an easy fix later on when we have more animals in the game. The particle animal is also stationary, as in, it doesnt animate with the player, however I have suggested a few plugins that could work, or I can look further into the particle system to try and make it work with the animal. Either way it looks good, and makes the posession look a lot more intersting.

### Reflection:
This week I took what I learnt about the particle system in Unity, and began making my own particle effects. I managed to create a deer shape that fades in over the time it takes to possess an animal, and it looks pretty good.

## Week 16:
Final week! I decided to add a quick cloud system into the game, using the same particles I used for the intro scene last term. I made a basic layout for them, and got them all working in the scene. They still need a few more tweaks to make them look more realistic, however that should be an easy fix for the future. This week also consisted of Mitchell, Adon and I all merging our projects. Adon had been working on some sound design and an updated day/night cycle while Mitchell and I worked on more bugs, so it was time to bring it all together. We decided to stray away from the traditional method of merging through GitLab due to all of our problems in the past, and instead chose to merge locally. This took a couple of days to get it working properly, but the game is completely merged together with almost no new bugs! 

## Overall Reflection:
I have learnt a lot from this project
